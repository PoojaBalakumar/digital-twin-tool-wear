# Multimodal Digital Twin for Tool Wear Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a **probabilistic multimodal digital twin** for indirect tool wear estimation using the **NASA Milling Tool Wear dataset**.  
The system integrates high-frequency sensor signals with machine process parameters to predict tool wear and quantify predictive uncertainty, enabling **risk-aware parameter recommendations**.

## Problem Statement
Manufacturing processes such as CNC milling are subject to **process drift**, which leads to tool wear, surface defects, and reduced product quality.  
Traditional monitoring approaches rely on handcrafted features and threshold-based alarms, which fail to generalize across operating conditions.

This project addresses the problem by developing a **data-driven digital twin** that:
- Predicts tool wear from multimodal sensor data
- Quantifies uncertainty in predictions
- Provides safe, risk-aware parameter recommendations
